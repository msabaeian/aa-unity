#### just another playing around with unity
[Link to original game](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aa/id905852173)


inspired by: [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBUIaZcv3U) with some additions by myself.

Goals:
- [DONE] create a game!
- [DONE] game manager and handling win / game over actions and have a few levels
- [DONE] animations and animator basics
- [DONE] GUI menu (Start, Continue and Exit)
- [DONE] save data -> ability to continue game from last checkpoint (level in this game)
- [TODO] use Input System (keyboard and Dual Sense)
- [TODO] add audio -> background music, sound effect for pin, win and loose
- [TODO/MAYBE] use a JSON file to define different levels instead of hard-coded switch-case
- [TODO/MAYBE] a better GUID and use new unity UI system (UIToolit?)
